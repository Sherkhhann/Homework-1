      The total territory is 143.1 thousand square kilometres. The population is
      7,510,800 people (as of October 1, 2009). The capital is Dushanbe. The
      currency unit is somoni, introduced in October 2000. The border of
      Tajikistan is 700 kilometres long from east to west and 350 kilometres
      long from north to south. The country shares borders to the west and north
      with Uzbekistan (910 kilometres) and Kyrgyzstan (630 kilometres); to the
      south with Afghanistan (1,030 kilometres); and to the east with China (430
      kilometres). The climate is continental. The average temperature in June and
      July is 30 C° to 35 C°. Modern Tajikistan is a mountainous country with
      absolute altitudes from 300 to 7495 meters above sea level. 93% of the
      country,s territory is occupied by mountain ranges of the Pamir, Gissar
      Alay and Tien Shan mountain systems. These ranges are divided by rich and
      fertile lands of the Fergana, Zerafshan, Vakhsh and Gissar valleys. The
      geographical complexity and the large amplitude of the mountain system
      heights determine the exceptional diversity of the plant and animal world.
